This project deals with controlling the boom barrier and traffic lights on the roads Automatically which will ensure the safety of the citizens, it will even have interrupts to make sure that if any lanes have emergency vehicles that lane should be cleared on priority, it will have a system in place to fine any vehicles which are not following rules of the roads by directly debiting the fine from the user's FASTag and finally it will have a timer so that eveyday at desired time all traffic will be halted for some time in the evening so that school children can pass to the other side of the road and also it can control the prdestrian gates.
