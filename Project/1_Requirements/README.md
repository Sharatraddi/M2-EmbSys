# Automatic Boom Barrier and Traffic Lights Controller

## **Description**

### This project deals with controlling the boom barrier and traffic lights on the roads Automatically which will ensure the safety of the citizens, It will have a system in place to fine any vehicles which are over speeding, It will have a system in place to fine any vehicles which are coming over the zebra crossing and blocking it for the people to pass during signal, And finally it will have a timer so that eveyday at desired time all traffic will be halted for some time so that people can pass to the other side of the road and also it can control the pedestrian gates.

## Identifying features
1. It shall control the boom barriers and traffic lights on the automatically according to out needs like we can program it 
2. It shall detect any over speeding vehicles on the road
3. It shall detect any vehicles which are over the zebra crossing during the signal
4. It shall fine these vehicles 
5. It shall control the pedestrain gates automatically

## State of art

1. The aim of this project is to bring out the human need for controlling the traffic and gates as it can be having its errors and caveats
2. The fining of the vehicles then and there it self will make sure everyone follows the road rules correctly, thus contributating to healthy road habits
3. So by implemeting the automatic traffic control system can reduce the human erros preventing bad things happening on the roads
